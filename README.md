# Char-RNN
Training RNN on my facebook messages
I have trained the RNN model on my Facebook messages. So the model will try to replicate how I conversate with people, therefore just by giving the initial character for an input, suppose 'h' it will create a whole message starting from the character 'h' like "how are you doing today"
