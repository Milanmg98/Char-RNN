# Char-RNN
# Training RNN on my facebook messages

I have trained the RNN model on my Facebook messages. So the model will try to replicate how I conversate with people, therefore just by giving the initial character for an input, suppose 'h' it will create a whole message starting from the character 'h' like "how are you doing today". As the model has been trained on an single character it become possible to train the model in and language.





 # How to get the messages 
To get your Facebook messages all you have to do is to go to the  “Download your information” tab and only download the messages from it.
Facebook will take a few hours to verify your download, after the verification process you can easily download all your messages history data to date which is quite amusing.


There are few things that you need to take care if you are training on your own dataset please visit it here to get more information: https://medium.com/@milangautam5198/things-you-need-to-take-care-when-training-rnn-on-your-facebook-messages-befbe3dea175
